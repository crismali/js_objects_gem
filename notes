notes

- setting a proc property on jsobject should:
  - calling obj.method_function should yield the function
  - calling obj[method] should yield the function
    - should calling it here call it in the context of the obj? yep
    - but calling the proc should execute in context of the obj (ie obj['func'].call)
  - calling obj.method should call the method in the context of obj

- calling obj.delete_property(symbol/string) should delete the property in every way

- if you call a function that exists on the object's prototype but not on the object itself
it should see if it's prototype has it and bubble the proc up to the object that's receiving the message
and then instance exec it
